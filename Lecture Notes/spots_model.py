# Code Example
#
# This module consists of a model for our Spots application.  The
# model is embodied, primarily, in a class called SpotsState.  A running
# instance of our Spots application contains one SpotsState object that
# represents, collectively, the application's state (i.e., the list of
# spots that currently exist).
#
# Each spot is itself represented as a Spot object, which know enough to
# allow us to easily manipulate and draw them.

import point



# This constant specifies the radius, in fractional coordinates, of the
# spots that are created.  Try changing this to be larger or smaller and
# see what happens.
SPOT_RADIUS_FRAC = 0.05



class Spot:
    def __init__(self, center: point.Point, radius_frac: float):
        '''
        Initialize a newly-created Spot object, given its center
        point (a Point object) and the spot's radius (in
        fractional coordinates).

        self._center = center

    def center(self) -> point.Point:

        '''
        return self._center


    def radius_frac(self):
        '''
        Returns the radius of this Spot, in terms of fractional
        coordinates.
        '''
        return self._radius_frac


    def contains(self, point: point.Point) -> bool:
        '''
        Returns True if the given Point object lies within
        this Spot, False otherwise.
        '''

        # Since Point objects know how to calculate a distance
        # between themselves and other Point objects, all we
        # need to do is ask the center point how far it is
        # from the given point; if that's less than or equal
        # to the radius, the given point is within the spot.

    def __init__(self):
        '''

        there are no spots.

    def handle_click(self, click_point: point.Point) -> None:
        '''
        Handle a click on the given point, by either removing the
        spot in which the point lies, or by adding a new spot centered
        at the given point.
        '''

        # Spot objects are stored in the order they've been created,
        # newer ones appearing later in the list than earlier ones.
        # We'll scan the list of spots backward looking for an existing
        # spot that contains the given point, so we'll match newer
        # spots when given a choice.  This is important, because newer
        # spots are drawn on top of older ones.
        #
        # Note, too, how simple this loop is.  Most of the hard stuff
        # -- conversions between coordinate systems, figuring out whether
        # a click lies within a particular spot -- is already handled in
        # other places.  When we've fashioned ourselves the right tools,
        # we can build other code more simply in terms of those tools.

        # instead create a new spot, centered where the click occurred.
