# As we saw in lecture, the send() and recv() methods that send and
# receive bytes can be cumbersome when our goal is to send and receive
# text.  It should always be our goal to find a better tool for a job
# when there is one -- or to build ourselves a better tool when there
 # isn't
#
# Fortunately, a better tool exists: we can ask a socket object to
# give us a "pseudo-file object," an object that behaves just like a
# file object, except that it reads or writes to the socket's underlying
# streams, instead of to a file.  We end up needing two of them: one that
# reads from the socket's input stream and another that writes to its
# output stream.  Once we have them, we can treat our socket a lot like
# a text file, using techniques we already know.
#
# On the other hand, this leaves us with three separate objects to manage:
# the socket, the pseudo-file object for reading, and the pseudo-file
# object for writing.  Our best move is to collect these into one data
# structure, which we can pass around wherever we need it.  We opted for
# a tuple in lecture (and in this example), but we'll see in the next
# example that a namedtuple would actually be a much better choice.

# The first few functions are centered around interacting with the user:
# asking for input and printing output in a clean form.  We keep these
# functions separate from the others, so that other functions become much

# The next few functions handle the conversation between our program and

# completely insulated from the details of how these functions work.
# So when we connect, we return a "connection" object -- which is really a
# tuple consisting of a socket and two pseudo-file objects, but no code
# outside of these functions ever needs to know about that; as far as other
# functions are concerned, a connection is simply an opaque object that
# represents a connection to an echo serve.r

    # Since a connection object is really a tuple, it's handy for us
    # to assign the tuple's values into three variables, so that the
    # variables can have meaningful names (as opposed to using an
    # unclear notation like connection[0], connection[1], and connection[2]).
    #
    # This relies on something you might not realize: You can take a tuple
    # and assign its values into separate variables like this:
    #
    #     >>> t = (1, 2, 3)
    #     >>> x, y, z = t
    #     >>> x
    #     1
    #     >>> y
    #     2
    #     >>> z
    #     3
    #
    # If this seems sort of silly to you, we'll clean this up in the next
    # example when we use a namedtuple for this instead, which will give
    # us what we want (a meaningful name for each object within the
    # connection object) without us having to do this every time.

    # There are a couple of details that we're handling here, so we
    # never have to remember to do them anywhere else

    # (1) We're being sure to put the correct newline sequence on the
    #     end of the message.  This is the right place to do that, since
    #     this is the function that is in charge of sending messages to
    #     the server (so it's the natural place to handle the details of
    #     exactly how the server wants it to look).
    #
    # (2) We have to remember to "flush".  File objects do something called
    #     "buffering".  When you write to them, they store data in memory
    #     temporarily and then write it once in a while when the buffer
    #     runs out of space.  This is mainly done because the act of actually
    #     writing the data -- especially when you're talking about files on a
    #     hard disk, but even when you're using a socket -- is much slower
    #     than storing it in memory, so only writing data once in a while can
    #     dramatically reduce that cost.  But when you're talking to another
    #     program vi a socket, it's usually important that a message is sent
    #     *now*, because the other program won't know what to do until it is
    #     received.  So it becomes important to tell the file object "Take
    #     whatever is in your buffer and send it now!  Don't wait until a
    #     opportune time!"  That's what flush() does.

    # slicing, since this is a detail of how we interact with the echo
    # server, but not something that the rest of the program needs to be

# like a high-level English description of what our program does, as opposed
# to overwhelming us with every detail.
